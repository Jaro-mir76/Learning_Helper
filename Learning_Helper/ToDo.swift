/*
 1. Dictionary of our words
 -> * Finish Word edit view
 2. Training
->    * check all words and find 1/few with worst ration (positive tests/all tests) or with 0/0
        -> Option 1: for practice build in memory array with rates of all words so finding words with worst stats can be fast
        option 2: go through all words and save only for example top 50 of the worst but I think checking/building these top 50 can be more expensive then option 1
    * give to the view question
    * get from view answer
    * give to the view feedback and update stats of the word from question
